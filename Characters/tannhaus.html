		<p>Tannhaus is the watchmaker. He is the author of the <a href="../Things/book.html">book</a> "A Journey Through Time". In 1986 adult <a href="jonas.html">Jonas</a> pays visit to him and asks him about his book, einstein-rosen bridges and time. Jonas then tells him that his theories are correct, that wormholes exist, in fact there is one in Winden, and that he comes from the future by using it. He gives him the time machine that he built, saying it's broken and that he needs to fix it.</p>
		<p>He already had the time machine, which Claudia asked him to buil in 1953, the machine didn't work and he was able to fix it only thanks to seeing the future time machine.</p>
