		<h2 id="teen">Teen</h2>
		<p>Jonas Kahnwald is the son of <a href="mikahn.html">Michael</a> and <a href="hannah.html">Hannah Kahnwald</a>. As a teenager, he is traumatized by his father's suicide, for which he seeks therapy with <a href="peter.html">Peter Doppler</a> during the summer. </p>
		<h2 id="041119">04/11/2019</h2>
		<p> Jonas goes along with his friends to the caves, searching for Erik's stack of drugs. After the loud noises coming from within, he runs away holding Mikkel's arm, but trips and loses sight of him. He has a vision of his father covered in dark liquid and runs away.</p>
		<h2>05/11/2019</h2>
		<p> He visits the attic where his father killed himself, there he finds a detailed map of Winden Caves hidden in the ceiling.</p>
		<h2>07/11/2019</h2>
		<p> Jonas meets his adult self at the graveyard. He had <a href="regina.html">Regina</a> delivered to him a package with some tools to explore the caves, including a detailed map, and his father's <a href="../Things/letter.html">suicide letter</a>.</p>
		<h2>08/11/2019</h2>
		<p>Jonas explores the caves and finds the <a href="../Things/sicmundus.html">Sic Mundus</a> passage. He opens the metal door and goes through it, meanwhile all lights in Winden start flickering. He comes across a fork and turns right, then after another metal door with the Sic Mundus incisions he exits from the cave in <a href="1986.html#081186">1986</a>.</p>
		<h2>08/11/1986</h2>
		<p>Jonas comes out of the caves and comes across his <a href="hannah.html">mother</a>, still a child, in a van with her father. They stop by since its raining heavily and offer him a ride, but he refuses and walks away.</p>
		<h2>09/11/1986</h2>
		<p> He goes to Winden's school and finds <a href="regina.html">Regina Tiedemann</a>, asks her about Michael Kahnwald, she says she only knows Ines Kahnwald and he could find her at the hospital. On the way back he is stopped by <a href="egon.html">Egon Tiedemann</a>, he lies to him about being hurt and is given a ride to the hospital.</p>
		<p>At the hospital he finds his grandmother <a href="ines.html">Ines</a>, she is with Mikkel. Before he could do anything his adult self stops him, saying that if he were to take Mikkel back then he would erase his own existance. He goes back to 2019 that same night and burns the letter that was given to him.</p>
		<h2>10/11/2019</h2>
		<p> Jonas goes to talk to his grandmother, she gives him the <a href="../Things/letter.html">letter</a> he thought he had burnt. After talking with Ines he goes back to <a href="../1986.html#101186">1986</a> . In the hospital he finds <a href="noah.html">Noah</a> in Mikkel's room, and is kidnapped by him and <a href="helge.html">Helge</a>. He wakes up in the bunker room, where adult Jonas will explain him who he is. He also tells him that free will is an illusion.</p>
		<p>After his adult self activates the time machine in the Sic Mundus passage, he sees a breach in time and young Hegel on the other side. They touch hands and he is sent in the bunker in <a href="../2052.html">2052</a>.</p>
		<p>In 2052 he is captured by <a href="elizabeth.html">Elizabeth</a> and almost executed, but he's freed by a girl in exchange for showing her what's in the forbidden zone that he had entered. Jonas takes her there and shows her the god particle, that he knows how to activate because of <a href="claudia.html">Claudia</a>'s tape recordings.</p>
		<p>Jonas travels to <a href="../1921.html">1921</a> using the god particle. After being taken care of by some folks at the inn, he meets young Noah, who was somehow expecting him. He goes back to the caves only to find out the passage is not built yet, so he's stuck in 1921. Young Noah was waiting outside for him and takes him to <a href="../Things/sicmundus.html">Sic Mundus</a> hideout. Inside the church adult Noah approaches them, he then takes him to <a href="adam.html">Adam</a>. He will explain who he is and that Sic Mundus wants to create a world where god and time don't exist. He says that time is an infinite loop and that everything is going to repeat itself. He then shows to him a wormhole similar to that of 2052 with which he'll travel to <a href="../2019#200619">2019</a>.</p>
		<p>Jonas visits his father <a href="mikahn.html">Michael</a> and tells him the truth. He says that he knows he's thinking about killing himself and shows him the <a href="../Things/letter.html">letter</a> Ines gave him, begs him not to do it, because then the cycle will repeat itself. This comes to Michael as a surprise, he replies "what if you are not here to stop me, but to show me what I have to do?". <a href="claudia.html">Old Claudia</a> joins them and says some thing shouldn't be undone, Jonas leaves realizing he is responsible for suggesting his father to kill himself.</p>
		<p>On <a href="../2019.html#041119">November 4th</a> Jonas follows his younger self to the caves, when they separate he quickly comes to Mikkel and takes him inside the cave, saying they had to pass the night there because of some danger outside. He will lead him to the exit to 1986 before leaving the boy on his own.</p>
		<h2>2020</h2>
		<p>Jonas will spend a year learning about time travel from old Claudia, he then travels to <a href="../1986.html#260687">1987</a> to explain adult Claudia things and taking her to 2020.</p>
		<p>On the day of the <a href="../2019.html#270620">apocalypse</a> Jonas goes to his house to save <a href="martha.html">Martha</a>, but <a href="adam.html">Adam</a> is also there and kills her. Two parallel realities happen afterwards: in one, Jonas is taken by future <a href="martha.html">Martha</a> to a parallel universe; in another Jonas survives the apocalypse hiding in the basement of his house.</p>
