		<h2>Teen</h2>
		<p>Jonas Kahnwald is the son of <a href="mikahn.html">Michael</a> and <a href="hannah.html">Hannah Kahnwald</a>. As a teenager, he is traumatized by his father's suicide, for which he seeks therapy with <a href="peter.html">Peter Doppler</a> during the summer. </p>
		<h2 id="041119">04/11/2019</h2>
		<p> Jonas goes along with his friends to the caves, searching for Erik's stack of drugs. After the loud noises coming from within, he runs away holding Mikkel's arm, but trips and loses sight of him. He has a vision of his father covered in dark liquid and runs away.</p>
		<h2>05/11/2019</h2>
		<p> He visits the attic where his father killed himself, there he finds a detailed map of Winden Caves hidden in the ceiling.</p>
		<h2>07/11/2019</h2>
		<p> Jonas meets his adult self at the graveyard. He had <a href="regina.html">Regina</a> delivered to him a package with some tools to explore the caves, including a detailed map, and his father's <a href="../Things/letter.html">suicide letter</a>.</p>
		<h2>08/11/2019</h2>
		<p>Jonas explores the caves and finds the <a href="../Things/sicmundus.html">Sic Mundus</a> passage. He opens the metal door and goes through it, meanwhile all lights in Winden start flickering. He comes accross a fork and turns right, then after another metal door with the Sic Mundus incisions he exits from the cave in <a href="1986.html#081186">1986</a>.</p>
		<h2>08/11/1986</h2>
		<p>Jonas comes out of the caves and comes across his <a href="hannah.html">mother</a>, still a child, in a van with her father. They stop by since its raining heavily and offer him a ride, but he refuses and walks away.</p>
		<h2>09/11/1986</h2>
		<p> He goes to Winden's school and finds <a href="regina.html">Regina Tiedemann</a>, asks her about Michael Kahnwald, she says she only knows Ines Kahnwald and he could find her at the hospital. On the way back he is stopped by <a href="egon.html">Egon Tiedemann</a>, he lies to him about being hurt and is given a ride to the hospital.</p>
		<p>At the hospital he finds his grandmother <a href="ines.html">Ines</a>, she is with Mikkel. Before he could do anything his adult self stops him, saying that if he were to take Mikkel back then he would erase his own existance. He goes back to 2019 that same night and burns the letter that was given to him.</p>
		<h2>10/11/2019</h2>
		<p> Jonas goes to talk to his grandmother, she gives him the <a href="../Things/letter.html">letter</a> he thought he had burnt. After talking with Ines he goes back to <a href="../1986.html#101186">1986</a> . In the hospital he finds <a href="noah.html">Noah</a> in Mikkel's room, and is kidnapped by him and <a href="helge.html">Helge</a>. He wakes up in the bunker room, where adult Jonas will explain him who he is. He also tells him that free will is an illusion.</p>
		<p>After his adult self activates the time machine in the Sic Mundus passage, he sees a breach in time and young Hegel on the other side. They touch hands and he is sent in the bunker in <a href="../2052.html">2052</a>.</p>
		<p>In 2052 he is captured by Elizabeth and almost executed, but freed by a girl in exchange for showing her what's in the forbidden zone that he had entered. Jonas takes her there and shows her the god particle, that he knows how to activate because of Claudia's tape recordings.</p>
		<p>Jonas travels to <a href="../1921.html">1921</a> using the god particle. After being taken care of by some folks he meets young Noah, he was somehow expecting him. He goes back to the caves only to find out the passage is not built yet, so he's stuck in 1921. Young Noah was waiting outside for him and takes him to Sic Mundus hideout. Inside the church adult Noah approaches them, he then takes him to <a href="adam.html">Adam</a>. He will explain who he is and that Sic Mundus wants to create a world where god and time don't exist. He says that time is an infinite loop and that everything is going to repeat itself. He then shows to him a wormhole with which he'll travel to <a href="../2019#200619">2019</a>.</p>
