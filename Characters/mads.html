		<p>Mads Nielsen was the son of Jana and Tronte Nielsen and brother of Ulrich. Mads disappeared in <a href="../1986.html#091086">1986</a> at the age of 12. He walked back home through the forest after walking Regina Tiedemann to her house because she was afraid of his brother Ulrich and Katharina. Regina was documented as the last person to see him alive in the police investigation. </p>
