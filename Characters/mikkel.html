On <a href="../2019.html#041119">November 4th</a>, he accidentally travels through time using the Winden Caves passage. He comes out in 1986 on <a href="../1986.html#051186">November 5th</a>, goes back to his home only to find a teenage Ulrich that stops him from entering his house and leaving with Katherina shortly after. He goes to the police station and talks to Egon Tiedman, who calls someone to look after him. Ines Kahnwand arrives and takes him to the hospital, later she'll take him home with her and adopt him, naming him <a href="mikahn.html">Michael Kahnwald</a>. That same night he goes back to the caves, unsuccessfully trying to find a way back. He will pass years studying the caves and will grow up.</p>
