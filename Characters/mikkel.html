		<p>Mikkel is the youngest son of <a href="ulrich.html">Ulrich</a> and <a href="katharina.html">Katharina</a> Nielsen.</p>
		<h2>04/11/2019</h2>
		<p>On <a href="../2019.html#041119">November 4th</a>, he accidentally travels through time using the Winden Caves passage. He comes out in 1986 on <a href="../1986.html#051186">November 5th</a>, tries to go back to his home only to find a teenage Ulrich that stops him from entering the house and leaving with Katherina shortly after. He goes to the police station and talks to Egon Tiedemann, who calls someone to look after him. Ines Kahnwand arrives and takes him to the hospital, later she'll take him home with her and adopt him, naming him Michael. That same night he goes back to the caves, unsuccessfully trying to find a way back. He will pass years studying the caves and will grow up as <a href="mikahn.html">Michael Kahnwald</a>.</p>
