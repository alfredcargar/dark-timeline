		<p>Mikkel accidentally travels through time in Winden Caves. He comes out in 1986, he goes back to his home only to find a teenage Ulrich that stops him from entering his house and leaving with Katherina shortly after. He goes to the police station and talks to Egon Tiedman, who calls someone to look after him. Ines Kahnwand arrives and takes him to the hospital, later she'll take him home with her and adopt him. That same night he goes back to the caves, hoping to find a way back.</p>
