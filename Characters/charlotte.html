		<p>In 2019 Charlotte is the chief of Winsten police, she is married to <a href="peter.html">Peter Doppler</a>, with whom she has two daughters: <a href="franziska.html">Franziska</a> and <a href="elizabeth.html">Elizabeth</a>. She is investigating the disappearence of the kids, as well as the dead boy found in the woods. The red soil found with the body did not match any soil near the location where he was found, after investigating the footage of a wild-life camera she sees <a href="peter.html">Peter</a>'s car passing by during the night. She starts suspecting him and goes to check the cabin in the woods that belonged to Helge, where she finds red soil similar to that found with the kid's body. There she also finds the bunker.</p>
