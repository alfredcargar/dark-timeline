		<p>Helge is <a href="peter.html">Peter</a>'s father. In 2019 he is an old man apparently senile, he keeps repeating "It's gonna happen again.", "It needs to be stopped.", "I have to stop Noah".</p>
		<p>He escapes from the hospital and travels back to 1986 to face his adult self. He confronts him saying that everything Noah says is a lie, they are not the chosen ones. He says Noah is pure evil, he tries to persuade him to stop but adult Helge runs away in shock.</p>
		<p>On November 13th 1986 he tries to kill him in a car accident, but dies instead.</p>
