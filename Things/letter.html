		<p>"Dear Jonas, by the time you read this everything will have already happened, irrevocably. Things can no longer be changed, I would have liked to have explained things to you sooner, but I hope that once you'll understand how everything is connected you will understand my decision. The truth is a strange thing, you can try to suppress it, but it will always find its way back to the surface. We turn a lie into our own truth in order to survive. We try to forget until we can't any longer. We don't know even half of the misteries of this world. We are wanderers in the darkness. This is my truth. On november 4th 2019 I travelled through time to the year 1986. The boy from the future stayed and in time he became a man. Mikkel became Michael. Never knew where he belonged. By the time you'll read this, I'll already be gone. Both as a boy and as a man. I hope you can forgive me, everything is connected."</p>
